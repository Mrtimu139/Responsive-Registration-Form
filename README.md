# Responsive-Registration-Form
This project consists of a responsive registration form built using HTML and styled with CSS. 
## About
The registration form includes fields for personal information, account type selection, file upload, and additional details such as age, referrer source, and a bio. The form incorporates client-side validation for required fields and a password pattern check. The project is designed with a modern and visually appealing user interface.
I created this project during the training section of the freeCodeCamp.org course by solving problems. It is one of the best-guided courses I have ever encountered. They teach us through problem-solving and project development, granting permission to add the projects to our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. It's truly a blessing for beginner developers.

## How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the "index.html" file in a web browser to view the registration form.
Fill out the form with the required information.
Click the "Submit" button to proceed with the registration.
